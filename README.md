# downhe.re

## What are we trying to accomplish right now, up until date X?
Building the first version of the downhe.re tool: a way to have high quality conversations about deep rooted societal systems, needs and wants, meeting great people with similar ideas and aspirations, and getting from talking to doing without barriers.

With that, we aim to build a platform that leverages that tool, to build an amazing community where big questions lead to even bigger conversations, that spark powerful collaborations and makes these projects visible to interested bystanders.

Around that, we want to build a supporting structure, that enables people around the world to contribute to this tool, platform and in the end, company. This organization should be able to provide guidance, money and help the community flourish.
