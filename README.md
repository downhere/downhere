**Who brings about change?**

*Everyone should be able to.*

So, together, we are creating downhe.re.

## Why

Today, fundamental change often comes (if at all) from the top down. On the other hand, we see many inspiring examples of grassroots change, set up by people from all over the world. Yet, unfortunately, these examples are the exceptions rather than the rule. Too many inspiring ideas and innovative projects don’t take off because of the obstacles they face; be it money, difficulty of finding like-minded people, lack of facilities, or time constraints of the people involved.

Together, we can change this. By creating a platform, (now) called downhe.re, we want to make it possible for anyone to bring about change. Whether by contributing ideas, interest, expertise, funds, time, or all of the above. downhe.re will facilitate whatever you need to make your envisioned change happen. It will help you find like-minded people, funds, visionaries and experts, collaboration tools, online and offline meeting spaces; whatever you need to make your idea into a reality.

To get there, we need your help! First of all, we need skilled people and funds to build the platform - without it, downhe.re doesn’t exist. But before we even start building, we want your input! Downhe.re is founded upon the great potential stored in any person: We need your ideas, your dreams, your skills, your feedback! Any minute or hour or week you can contribute doing what you do best will help enormously in making downhe.re into a reality.

## What

A platform and community to facilitate change of the things fundamental to our day-to-day lives. A place where ideas, creativity and resources meet, and ideas become reality.

## Timeline & goals

As a project, downhe.re will be working with and progressing in 'sprints': Periods of two weeks each, within which we set a series of goals that we want to reach within that sprint. Each sprint will have a specific focus, shared below, and issues with specific action points you can work with on this GitHub page.

### [Sprint 1: week 40-41, 3 October - 16 October](https://github.com/downhere/downhere/milestone/1)

- [Validating all textual, informative material so far and assess where more information is needed](https://github.com/downhere/downhere/issues/3)
 
### Goal #1: 20 November

Our first major goal, set to be reached on the 20th of November, is twofold:

1. A community that is building the platform
2. A first version of the product
 
Between now (the first sprint) and the 20th of November are 3-4 sprints, with goals focused on reaching the abovementioned goals on the 20th of November. Together, we will specify these goals over the next few weeks.

### Within one year

Within a year, we aspire to collaboratively have created a version of the platform in which an idea can undergo the whole course from birth to reality, or end result, on downhe.re, using the tools that we imagine to be part of the platform.

### Past sprints

#### Sprint 0: week 38-39, 19 September - 2 October

During this first (offline) sprint, we focused on:

- Launching the GitHub page and updating the website
- Setting goals for the next sprint
- Creating issues on GitHub for each of the action points for the current & next sprint
 
## Contributing

Everyone is invited to contribute! We hope that your dreams for a platform for collaborative world change will inspire you not only to be curious, but to contribute in whichever way you can and want to. We're using this project to coordinate the work being done on downhe.re.

### What can I do *now*?

We are currently in sprint 1, which's main goals, as mentioned above, include launching the GitHub page and issues, validating all textual, informative material, and setting goals for the next few sprints.

You can contribute by [working on any of the open issues](https://github.com/downhere/downhere/issues) right now, for example:

Or [create your own issue](https://github.com/downhere/downhere/issues/new), based on what you value as important right now, or can best contribute to.

The goals we set for the current sprint are based on our current main areas of focus:

## Where did downhe.re come from?

The first ideas that amounted to what we now call downhe.re were coined by two crazy thinkers called Bas and Gerrit. Over four years ago, they started taking train rides together, discussing ideas for tools to bring about change. This is where dreams for a platform like downhe.re first began. Over these past years, they have talked and thought through many aspects of the platform, but also recognized that a platform relying on the potential of a community of people to bring about change best be built by a community. That is why we opened up downhe.re and invite you to join.
